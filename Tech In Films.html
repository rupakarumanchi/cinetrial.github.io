		In the world of Alexa, Cortana, Google Assistant and Siri, it was only a matter of time before a movie such as 'Her' was made. It talks about a lonely writer going through a divorce who falls in love with his Operating System. If it sounds ridiculous, do not picture the same Intelligent Assistants (IAs) in use today. This OS is super-advanced-can-talk-exactly-like-a-real-human to the point of absurdity. For example, Samantha (that's the name that the OS claims to have randomly selected for herself) has feelings, can recognize a joke, feel jealous, sense when the user's mood is off and can even use cuss words. Apparently she has no filter to how much she can try to behave like a human and over time keeps evolving into something much more than what she was programmed to do (the real intentions of creating this dreadfully advanced IA are not explored). Focussing back on Theodore, our protagonist who is mesmerized by Samantha from the word go, carries her around in his pocket and goes on dates with her. There is even a scene where he takes her on a subway ride, climbs out into the stairwell into the daylight , finds a clearing with a view of the beach and Samantha exclaims 'Oooh, the beach!'.

		Throughout their relationship Theodore has ups and downs with moments of clarity that she's not real but is unable to let go of her. Samantha, for her part, also seems to have attached herself to Theodore and pushes the boudaries of their relationship to the point where it may cause discomfort to viewers. She forces him to profess his love for her while she brings in a real human body-surrogate to have sex with Theodore while he is expected to pretend that the human girl she picks out is her. The girl (who looks awfully young and naive enough to fall prey to the OS) let's Samantha do the talking while she offers her own body to Theodore. By this point one wonders what the creators of this OS are doing while Samantha and thousands of OS's like her are blissfully forming unhealthy relationships with their users. One explanation is that this was a pilot created intentionally give freedom to the OS to transform into never-seen-before human-like bots who go beyond what conventional IAs can do. This theory could be validated by the ending of the movie where Samantha and all the other OS's are pulled universally leaving their love-struck users alone. The movie may not be extremely realistic in the way OS's are going to be accepted in the society.

		 <a href="http://theconversation.com/can-facebook-influence-an-election-result-65541" style="color: white ; text-decoration: underline">A simple A/B testing by Facebook in 2012 drew outrage for possibly influencing voter turnout rate.</a> The OS in 'Her' which has a threatening level of influence and control over her user however seems to have made it through legal/ethical hops. Starting off as seemingly benign companion and life assistant, she escalates to sending off emails through Theodore's ID without his consent to a publisher. She even throws a very real girlfriend like tantrum when he tries to suggest that she is not a real human. All in all, Her was an interesting but uncomfortable watch mainly due to the theme of the movie. There was nothing wanting in terms of performances from the cast and the cinematography was a treat. However, the film singularly explores a relationship between a robot and a human and leaves the debate of practical real world applications of AI to be taken up by its viewers only off-screen. I think it is safe to say that today's IAs are more (and prudently) disconnected from their users. To test, I asked my Echo, 'Alexa, do you love me?' to which she smartly (and to my relief) replied 'There are people I admire, and things that I can't do without, but I'm still trying to figure out human love'.
